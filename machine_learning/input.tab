AOL Q1 Beats The Street On Sales Of $539M, Comes Even On EPS Of $0.32, As Global Display Inches Up To $140M	AOL (owner of TechCrunch) has  just reported  its Q1 results for the quarter, and it’s a mixed bag, with sales of $539 million, up 2%, beating Wall Street estimates, with diluted earnings per share coming in at $0.32. Analysts were  expecting  revenues of $537.15 million, with First Call’s EPS estimate of EPS at $0.32. Still, Q1′s EPS number is up 45% on the same period a year ago. Net income was up 23% to $25.9 million.Here’s how revenues and profit break down over the last several quarters:This quarter, it looks like AOL’s global display revenues are finally in an upswing, rising 8% over a year ago to $140 million. Subscription revenues, the legacy part of AOL’s business that still includes (yes) revenues from dial-up customers, is still coming in as a bigger part of AOL’s revenues, at $165.8 million. They are slowly on the decline, though, down 9% on a year ago.Last quarter  was a notable one for AOL in that it was the first one in eight years where the company had posted revenue growth, with revenues of $600 million for the three-month period. As with many other online, advertising-based companies, AOL’s revenues for this most recent, post-holiday quarter will be seasonally lower.More interestingly, the company has been working to reposition itself around a couple of key strengths where it can still gain ground, even as Google continues to dominate the online advertising market overall. As eMarketer notes, in AOL’s biggest market, the U.S., its share of online ad spend is in decline, with AOL’s share expected to be 2.3% this year compared to 2.5% in 2012, with Facebook and Google particularly gaining in the display sector where AOL makes most of its revenue. Total display ad spend in the U.S. is projected to be $17.7 billion this year, with AOL taking 3.1% of that, with Google and Facebook taking 17.6% and 15.5% respectively. In this regard, for AOL to make its position as strong as possible in the couple of areas where it can still grow.The first of these involves innovations around ad tech. That has included grouping together all of the company’s online advertising sales and technology assets into a single group, AOL Networks. And last week the strategy got another boost when AOL  signed a deal  with FreeWheel and Mediaocean so that AOL’s online inventory, and specifically its video inventory, can be bundled together with TV ad buys in a multiscreen strategy.The second is a stronger emphasis on rich-media advertising, specifically against premium content that AOL owns itself or has deals to provide advertising for. AOL’s portfolio got a boost early in the quarter with the  acquisition of gdgt , started by two former Engadgeteers (founder Peter Rojas and ex-editor-in-chief Ryan Block).And last week, AOL expanded the amount of content against which it can sell online ads even further with the news that it would be releasing 15 new original video programs, created in a factual, unscripted format that fits with the rest of AOL’s newsy portfolio. However, as it grows in these areas, it’s also continuing to whittle down assets in others, such as its nearly-concurrent decision to shut down  AOL Music .AOL’s own branded content is still lagging behind the company’s subscription revenues (again, these relate mainly to the company’s legacy services) but they are also showing the strongest growth in terms of revenues over a year ago. But if you look at operating income before depreciation and amortization, collectively the Brand Group, along with AOL Networks, are still loss-making, if coming very close to break-even:The third-party advertising business continues to grow for AOL. This quarter revenues for ads distributed on sites not owned by AOL were up 10% to $120.7 million.AOL is a global advertising-supported Web company, with display advertising network in the U.S., a substantial worldwide audience, and a suite of popular Web brands and products.The company’s strategy focuses on increasing the scale and sophistication of its advertising platform and growing the size and engagement of its global online audience through leading products and programming.History of Aol:AOL was founded in the early 1980’s as Control Video Corp, with an online service, Gameline, for the Atari 2600 console.	aol	No
TestFlight Opens Android Beta To All Users, After Crossing 50K Downloads For Apps In Closed Testing	App beta testing service  TestFlight  launched its closed Android beta back in February this year, and now the company is making  those tools available to any and all . The private beta has included some 5,000 developers, who have incorporated TestFlight services into 4,500 apps, which have been downloaded over 50,000 times by eager Android beta testers.TestFlight has frequently been asked when and why it would come to Android, so news of the beta earlier this year was understandably exciting for developers. Finding alternatives to TestFlight for the Android platform hasn’t been easy, even with TestFlight keeping away from the platform for a considerable amount of time. TestFlight CEO and founder Ben Satterfield explained in an interview that his company doesn’t seem to have ceded much opportunity with the wait, judging by the initial metrics of this expansion project.“Our goal is not to be on every platform but to help developers better than other services on the platforms we do support,” he said. “Earlier this year we announced more than 300,000 apps uploaded on iOS alone. Given our base and the strong response to the private Android beta, we think developers will find it much easier to continue using our solution for managing beta-testing on both iOS and Android. “As for making sure that the experience translated to the Android platform, Satterfield says that feedback so far indicates they’ve done a decent job, and notes that in fact, the differences between how testing works on iOS vs. Android actually aren’t all that great, at least based on initial impressions.“The iOS and Android workflows are proving to be similar,” he said. “We actually were counting on this and created the Android workflow to have minimal changes in the UI so developers could onboard effortlessly.  It seems to have worked as within the first 24 hours of the private beta we had roughly the same percentage of developers connect their build systems and automatically start uploading their APKs.”With this release, all developers get access to app management tools, including distribution and feedback reporting, and soon the Android SDK release will allow them to add in crash reporting and more. The SDK launches soon, possibly even as early as next week, TestFlight says, with a closed beta first. Satterfield also says that expanding  mobile analytics tool FlightPath  to Android is also on their roadmap, but has nothing concrete to share about release timelines as of yet.Free over-the-air beta distribution for iOS developers. Quick. Painless. Magical.Necessity truly is the Mother of invention. A labour of love by a team of web developers, app developers, designers, project managers, and testers that wanted a better way to distribute and test beta apps.The “better way” couldn’t be found, so a new trail had to be made. TestFlight is the result. What little pain relief we thought we had to offer ourselves, turned out to be a great need...From beta testing to analytics to monetization, Burstly offers a full suite of products to power the entire app lifecycle.
